 * Create Nagplot::Core::Types superset
   This superset could ease creating Nagplot::Core::Types::* like
   objects since their Signature is mostly the same.

   Example calling convention could be:

   my $error = Nagplot::Core::Type->new('Error',
      { response => 'foo',
        message => 'bar', 
        metadata => {
          debug => Dumper($self)
        }
      });
